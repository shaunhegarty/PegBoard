\section{Intro}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Problem Definition: The Peg Board}
		\begin{figure}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{pegboardlayout}
		\end{figure}
		Consider a board with holes in which coloured pegs can be placed. For this problem we have: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item pegs of two colours
			\item an equal number of each
			\item a board with enough spaces for all pegs
			\item one additional space which allows for movement
		\end{itemize}
		Rules:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A peg adjacent to the space may move into it
			\item A peg may jump over a peg adjacent to the space into that space
		\end{itemize}	
		
	\end{frame}
		
\section{Design}
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Design: Breaking it down}
		The aim is to move all pegs of one colour to the other side of the board in the minimum number of steps
		while following the rules.
		
		\begin{figure}
		\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{pegboardmoves}
		\end{figure}
		
		Given the rules we can see that there are only four moves possible at any one time. 
		
		
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Design: Approaching an Algorithm}
		The problem was solved manually numerous times to determine a pattern.
		\blt
			\item Initial algorithm was effective but inefficient
			\item However, continued efforts revealed a best case algorithm
		\finblt
		\vfill
		I determined that the minimum number of steps for a board of a given size could be calculated with following definition:
		\[
		f(n) = 
			\begin{cases} 
				f(n - 2) + n & \textrm{if}\; n \geq 3 \;\textrm{and}\; n \;\textrm{odd}\\
				0 & \textrm{if}\; n < 3
		 	\end{cases}
		\]
		where n is the number of spaces on the board.		
		
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Design: The Algorithm I - Conditions and Rules}
		\textbf{Starting conditions:} 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The board is set with the hole in the middle
		\item Pegs on either side will be made of one colour only. 
		\item We have a predecided starting direction/colour of which we keep track. 
		\end{itemize}
		
		When determining the next move to be made the algorithm uses the following rules:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Pieces of the colour on the left, can only make moves to the right, and vice versa
			\item Thus the current direction of moves is tied to the colour
			\item Prioritize moves of size two, then one. 
			\item If no move can be made in the current direction, change direction
			\item Direction is stored simply as +1 or -1. 
		\end{itemize}
		
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Design: The Algorithm II - The Pseudocode}
		The solving loop:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] while (!finished)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[] nextMove()
			\end{itemize}		
		\end{itemize}
		\bigskip
		nextMove() method:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] \textbf{if} (current colour can jump over a different colour into hole (in an allowed direction))
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[] move(2 * direction)
			\end{itemize}	
			\item[] \textbf{else if}	(current colour can move into the hole \& be placed adjacent 
			to a different colour (in an allowed direction))
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[] move(1 * direction)
			\end{itemize}
			
			\item[] \textbf{else if}	((hole is at edge of board \& direction is away from the edge of the board) \\
			OR (pieces beyond the space are all in their final positions))
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[] move(1 * direction)
			\end{itemize}
			\item[] \textbf{else} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[] change direction
			\end{itemize}

		\end{itemize}

		\begin{columns}[T]
			\begin{column}{.5\textwidth}
				\begin{block}{Another pattern}
				Having run my algorithm a number of times and printing the board with each step, 
				this symmetric zigzag pattern becomes apparent. \\\medskip
				My solution uses the hole as a reference frame and ignores everything outside
				of that frame. If instead I took the perspective of the board as a whole I would 
				have taken this approach
				\end{block}

\section{Analysis}
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Some Analysis}
					

			\begin{figure}
				\includegraphics[height=6cm]{pegboardtime}
			\end{figure}
			The time to complete the solution scaled linearly with the number of moves for large board sizes.	
			
	\end{frame}

\section{Demo}
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Program Demo and that little bit more}
		To complement the solution I created a GUI in which the user can both play the game, or 
		watch the solution presented step by step. \\
		\vfill
		The user can click on any piece, if this piece can make a valid move into the hole, it will. \\
		\vfill
		The user can also increase or decrease the size of the board, and reset the board at any time. 
		
	\end{frame}
\section{Limitations \& Future Work}
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Limitations \& Future Work}
		Limitations
		\blt
			\item The algorithm does not solve the puzzle for an incomplete non-optimal solution. \\
			\tab i.e. if the algorithm was tasked finishing a game in which someone had made a move which
			 would not lead to a solution in the minimum number of steps, it would fail
		\finblt
		
		Future Work
		\blt
			\item Make implementations of alternate algorithms 
			\item Make the algorithm work for any starting point
			\item The problem can be expanded in numerous ways, such as to a 2D or 3D board which still 
			only has one space for movement
			
		\finblt
	\end{frame}
\section{Reflection}
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Reflection: What did I learn?}

		\blt
			\item Need to step back and look at the bigger picture more often. 
			\item Sometimes miss 
			more obvious patterns by breaking things down too quickly.
			\vfill
			\item I used this assignment as a vehicle to learn about the Graphics2D library in Java. 
			\item In the process I learned about key bindings, mouse listeners and even a little bit about 
			threads and concurrency. 
		\finblt
		

	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Reflection: What could I have learned?}
		What could I have learned?
		\blt
			\item I only acquired the information I needed to make threads work in my program
			\item I know I didn't touch on vast areas of concurrency such as
			\blt
				\item multithreading
				\item resource locking
				\item synchronisation
			\finblt 
			and more to tackle before I would consider myself to be approaching competency in that area. 
			\item I toyed with animating the blocks moving to each new location. I feel it was 
			feasible but (as far as I could tell) I would have had to change my implementation of the 
			pegboard class to make it work effectively. 
		\finblt
	\end{frame}
\section{Conclusion}	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Conclusion}
		I successfully created an application which could solve the given pegboard problem.\\\medskip
		Additionally I created a GUI which allowed the user to attempt to solve it themselves
		or watch the program solve it. \\\medskip
		I learned a great deal of new content for the latter part as well as some areas in which I can improve myself.
